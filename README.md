### Hi there 👋

I'm David Journo, Freelance Fullstack Developper looking to be part of innovative projects, I love to share knowledge and ideas on how we can solve problems with quality and sustainable solutions.

🔭 I’m currently working on creating my own blog with Next.js / Ghost CMS as a side project for my business and publishing my own content about web security, best practices in web quality and also sustainable apps.

For 2022, 🌱 I’m currently learning about Web 3 and How, as a developper, we can make it sustainable and green. And more others things such as Nest.js and No-code tools.

👯 I’m always looking to collaborate on projects. So feel free to reach me here on github 📫 

If you want to work with me, let's connect.
